Below is an example of how you can translate the provided SQL schema into Django model definitions suitable for a PostgreSQL database. Several points to note:

Primary Keys

By default, Django creates an id field if no primary key is defined. If you want to match your schema exactly (e.g., user_id, membership_id), define them explicitly as AutoField(primary_key=True, db_column='...').
ENUM Fields

Django does not have a native ENUM field. Typically, we simulate using a CharField with choices.
For example, membership_type ENUM('Standard', 'Premium', 'Staff') becomes:
python
Copy

Check Constraints

Some constraints like CHECK (publication_year <= YEAR(CURRENT_DATE)) are not trivial to replicate in Djangoâ€™s built-in checks because it involves database functions.
We can either (A) skip it in Django (and rely on application logic), or (B) use RawSQL in a models.CheckConstraint if we want the exact DB-level check in PostgreSQL.
JSON Field

For tags JSON, Django supports JSONField (in django.db.models for Django 3.1+). For PostgreSQL, you get full JSON support.
ON DELETE / ON UPDATE

Translating MySQL-like ON DELETE/ON UPDATE to Django: you can specify on_delete=models.CASCADE, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, on_delete=models.RESTRICT, etc. However, Django does not directly handle ON UPDATE CASCADE. Database triggers might be needed for that behavior. Typically, Django does not rely heavily on ON UPDATE CASCADE because updates to primary key fields are rare.
Unique / Composite PK

For tables like Role_Permissions (many-to-many via PK of (role_id, permission_id)), we can define them with primary_key=True for both fields or use the unique_together approach.
Alternatively, in Django, many-to-many relationships are often implemented with ManyToManyField. But here, we follow your explicit schema.
Order of Model Creation

Django requires foreign key references to models that are already defined or use string references like 'self' or 'app_label.ModelName'.
In one file, you can define them in a logical order. If a model references another defined later, you can reference it by its string name.
